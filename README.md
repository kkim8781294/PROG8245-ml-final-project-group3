## Dataset Description

### 1. Clickbait Headline Dataset
For this project, we use the **Clickbait Headline Classification Dataset** from Kaggle.  
It contains **32,000 news headlines**, each labeled as either **clickbait (1)** or **non-clickbait (0)**.

The headlines were collected from two categories of news sources:

- **Clickbait sources:**  
  BuzzFeed, Upworthy, ViralNova, ScoopWhoop, Thatscoop  
  (These sources use curiosity-driven or sensational titles.)

- **Non-clickbait sources:**  
  The New York Times, The Guardian, WikiNews, The Hindu  
  (These follow traditional fact-based journalism.)

The dataset is **balanced** with nearly equal instances of both classes, making it ideal for binary supervised learning.
